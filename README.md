# Practice Notebooks — Brief overview

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks that document short practice exercises and examples I worked through while learning core data-science and Python tools. Below is a concise summary of each notebook and how to run them.

Notebooks
- [python_from_scratch.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna324-art/Practice_Notebooks/blob/main/python_from_scratch.ipynb)  
  Short: Python fundamentals — variables, data types, control flow, functions, and simple examples to build a foundation.

- [NumpyPractice.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna324-art/Practice_Notebooks/blob/main/NumpyPractice.ipynb)  
  Short: Numpy basics — array creation, indexing/slicing, broadcasting, vectorized operations and simple linear-algebra examples.

- [pandaspractice.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna324-art/Practice_Notebooks/blob/main/pandaspractice.ipynb)  
  Short: Pandas essentials — DataFrame creation, reading data, cleaning, selection, groupby/aggregation and basic data transformations.

- [Datavisualisation.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna324-art/Practice_Notebooks/blob/main/Datavisualisation.ipynb)  
  Short: Data visualization — examples using Matplotlib and Seaborn (line, bar, scatter, histograms, boxplots) and basic plot customization.

- [Scikitlearnpractice.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna324-art/Practice_Notebooks/blob/main/Scikitlearnpractice.ipynb)  
  Short: scikit-learn practice — preprocessing, train/test split, training simple models (classification/regression), evaluation metrics and cross-validation.

- [statistics.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna324-art/Practice_Notebooks/blob/main/statistics.ipynb)  
  Short: Statistics fundamentals — descriptive statistics, distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and correlation.
